To run cmake an environment variable MATHEMATICA_ROOT is required, which points to where Mathematica is installed:

env MATHEMATICA_CMAKE=<path-to-mathematica-root> cmake <path-to-src>

When compiled to use the export program need to copy
/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/11.3/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux-x86-64/libWSTP64i4.so
libexport_hdf5.so

to a location under ldconfig
