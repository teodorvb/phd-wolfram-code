Before running simulations the library for exporting in HDF5 needs to be
created. To do that follow the instructions in exportHDF5/src/README

To run the simulations for adjusting the parameters
  Run
   ./adjust-parameters.wls

To run the level detection simulations
  For simulation with levels chosen by markov chain run
    ./level-detection-markov-chain.wls <first-batch-id>
  The script will create 10 batches with simulated tracks.

  For Simulation with level manually chosen run:
    ./level-detection-manual.wls
  The script will create 1 batch with simulated tracks.

To run the simulations for classify smi
  For analysale tracks
    ./classify-smi-analysable.wls <first-batch-id>
  The script will generate 10 batches of analysable tracks.

  For non analysable tracks
    ./classify-smi-na.wls <first-batch-id>
  The script will create 10 batches with 9 cases for each batch of non
  analysable tracks.

To run the simulations for refining track selection process
  Run with no arguments
    ./refining-track-selection.wls
  The script will create analysale and non-analysable tracks. The analysable
  tracks should have some which can be used in a study (ci < 10nm sep < 60nm)
  and some which cannot be used.

Each simulation will need beads.
  To crete them run
    ./beads.wls
   The script will create beads.
